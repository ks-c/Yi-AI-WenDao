# WenDao AI (ÈóÆÈÅì)

English |¬†[‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md)

WenDao AI digitalizes the traditional "coin tossing" divination process and integrates powerful AI Large Language Models to provide you with deep interpretations that have both traditional charm and a modern perspective. Whatever puzzles you, you can use this application to seek inspiration from ancient wisdom and receive analysis and suggestions tailored for you by AI.

## ‚ú® Feature Highlights

- **Traditional Divination Simulation**: Fully simulates the three-coin toss method, automatically generating the Primary Hexagram, Changing Lines, and the Resulting Hexagram with clear results.

- **Multi-Platform AI Support**: Users can freely choose and configure Large Language Models from various platforms, including SiliconFlow, Suanli, and OpenAI.

- **In-Depth AI Interpretation**: An optimized prompt guides the AI to not just explain the hexagrams but also to analyze the evolutionary trend from the "Primary" to the "Resulting" hexagram, offering more profound and actionable insights.

- **Aesthetic Hexagram Display**: Uses visually appealing characters to draw the hexagrams and clearly marks the changing lines for easy understanding.

- **Personalized Configuration**: Automatically saves user settings (like API Key, selected platform, and model) for immediate use on the next launch, no reconfiguration needed.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A graphical interface built with tkinter, featuring intuitive controls and three separate panes for the divination process, traditional results, and AI interpretation.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Written in Python, it can run on multiple operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üì¶ Packaging for Distribution

If you want to run this application on a computer without a Python environment, you can package it into a standalone executable file (e.g., for Windows).

1. **Install PyInstaller**:  
   pip install pyinstaller

2. **(Optional) Install UPX to reduce file size**:
   
   - Download and extract it from the UPX GitHub Releases.
   
   - Add the path to upx.exe to your system's environment variables, or simply copy it into the project's root directory.

3. **Execute the Packaging Command**:  
   Using a .spec file is recommended for fine-grained control and a smaller output.
   
   a.¬†**Generate .spec file**:  
   pyinstaller --windowed --name WenDao-AI iching_ai_app.py
   
   b.¬†**Edit WenDao-AI.spec**:  
   In the Analysis section, add non-essential modules like ['tkinter.test', 'unittest', 'sqlite3'] to the excludes list.  
   In the EXE section, ensure upx=True.
   
   c.¬†**Package using the .spec file**:  
   pyinstaller --onefile WenDao-AI.spec

After packaging is complete, you will find the WenDao-AI.exe file in the dist folder.
